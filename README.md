## My process

I largely used HTML to build the card skeleton and CSS for the animation and stylings.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Animation

### What I learned
I largely learnt how the little things like solid in making border colours can make a huge difference and give you a headache when ommitted
I learnt how to draw a line which is something new to me.

```html
<p>My design was good</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm proud of</p>
```
```css
hr {
color: papayawhip;
width:2px;
height:1px;
}
```
This makes a line between the two paragraphs, the line will have a thickness of 1px and a length of 2px with the color papayawhip.
